# Enriques Password-Generator

## Description

I've created a password generator that will generate a passwork between 8-128 charaters long using either, numbers , symbols and lower and uppercase letters with javascript. The generator helps you choose a secure password at the length you desire. 

## Usage

When using the password generator you will be prompted with a set of messages asking you various questions about the password you desrire. It will ask about the length of characters you'd like, if you want numbers, symbols or lower and uppercase letters. If you dont declare any of the requirements then the generator will automatically default to lowercase letts.

## Features

Some features in this application are that when you give the prompt a password length amount under 8 character or over 128 characters then you will be prompted to choose a correct amount. As well as if you choose cancel to all the given prompts about what you want the password to consist of then the generator will just deault to all lowercase letters.
